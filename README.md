# Github Explorer

Github Explorer is a web application that lets you search for users on github and view basic information about them. It is a purely react application without ay backend. It uses react and axios to make requests to the github api to retrieve the needed data and render it. All the logic exists and runs on the client-side i.e the browser. This is essentially a single page application where routing is done using react-router-dom module.

Try out the application here: [https://github-explorer-yashspr.netlify.com/](https://github-explorer-yashspr.netlify.com/)
